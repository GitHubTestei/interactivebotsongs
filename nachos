Nachos by BabyChiefDoIt
Uh, uh
Uh, old bitch-ass niggas know what the fuck goin' on (brraow)
I don't wanna talk to you niggas
And I don't wanna hang with you niggas (slatt, uh, slatt, get the fuck on, bitch, bitch)
26-12 only
Dumpin' at him, make him stop, drop, roll (make him roll, make him roll)
That bitch pussy loose, her shit wider than a pothole (uh)
She tryna call me sassy just because I block hos (like, what?)
Boy, you bogus as hell, you kissin' block hos (uh)
Boy, we got more shells than a taco (uh)
Don't touch my cheese, bitch, this not yours (mine)
Want beef? We got heat, cookin' pot roast (bitch)
I knew he died first, nigga, I was front row (brrt, brrt, baow)
One-night stand, fell in love with a freak (uh)
One night turned to two and two nights turned to three (goddamn)
Even though bro said hos'll lie they through they teeth
I ain't listen to his ass, now, shame on me (goddamn)
Where I first went wrong is when I took the bitch home (nuh-uh)
Second time I fucked up 'cause I was thinkin' with my bone (what the fuck?)
I know I'm young, but I ain't even close to done (baow, baow)
Why the bitch leave the room every time she on the phone? (Gettin' weird)
Third time I fucked up 'cause I ain't even lock the door (what the fuck?)
Fourth time I fucked up 'cause I was thinkin' I was grown (grown)
By the fifth time, three niggas ran in my home (like, damn)
Sixth fuck up, the bitch came, and I ain't had my pole (uh, goddamn)
Dumpin' at him, make him stop, drop, roll (make him roll, make him roll)
That bitch pussy loose, her shit wider than a pothole (uh)

Second day, I woke up changed, now it's fuck love
I can't trust shit but my gloves and my gun (baow, baow)
I don't need a bitch 'cause I'm a fucking thug
But at the same time, every gangster need a fucking hug
I ain't forgot shit, I'm still tryna spank the bitch (uh, uh, uh)
She wipin' noses left to right, the lil' ho need a handkerchief (uh)
Catch the ho and wrap her wig around her neck and hang the bitch (uh)
Turn L's into dubs, I don't fuckin' play that shit (die L's, bitch)
Day one, I'm out plottin', the bitch done robbin'
I just got a call, she gon' be headed to the party (uh, uh, uh, uh)
My mans tryna stop me, but I'm like, "Fuck off" (get the fuck off me, dude)
'Cause soon as I get the drop, shots goin' through her body (baow, baow, baow)
She such a pretty girl, slim waist, fat ass
But when I'm done, I'ma leave the bitch sloppy (blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt)
My mans keep sayin' that the feds gon' come knockin' (uh, they gotta catch me, bitch)
But they gotta catch me first, bitch
I feel like John Gotti (ooh, they gotta catch me, bitch, baow)
Dumpin' at him, make him stop, drop, roll (make him roll, make him roll)
That bitch pussy loose, her shit wider than a pothole (bitch)
She tryna call me sassy just 'cause I block hos (on uh, that's stretched out-ass pussy)
Boy, you bogus as hell, you kissin' block hos (uh)
Boy, we got more shells than a taco (baow, baow)
Don't touch my cheese, bitch, this not yours (uh)

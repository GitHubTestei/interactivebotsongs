Element by Zvch
Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate?
And how much can I be expected to tolerate?
So I started to think about the plans I made
The debt unpaid
And you just can't call
A spade a spade
I mixed all that shit, it's in my cup, it's in my element
I got hella hella hoes that hit my phone that say I'm heaven sent
Well heaven said, "What's heaven sent?"
'Cause bitch yo ass ain't relevant
You just wanna fuck me and my gang 'cause you see racks as hella rizz
Kick this bitch out, we gon' dust her
She so bad, she my lil slut
And my choppa trans, it's always tucked boss
I rock V-Lone, I rock Lush
She number 2 so she fuck cursed
My diamonds cold, they make me blush
And this bitch gettin' mad but you no cuss
Wow, bitch wanna fuck I'm like "wow"
Diamonds so big, get me clout
And she wanna fuck on my bro
No, woah
I fuck on that bitch and then go (how?, woah)
I ride GLE, swipe her left 'cause I know that bitch ain't believe me
I see it's my time to blow, I put that shit on G-O-D
Got hella hoes up on my phone, they all want pics of dick
I see photos of this bitch, say in her past life
She see diamonds bigger than the TV
She wan' live this rad life
Now I got more racks than everybody
I don't care 'bout that shit, I like to throw it all
I got toolies tucked up in my pants, my overalls
Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate?
And how much-
Song over

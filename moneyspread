Money Spread by Ken Carson
Huh, money spread, money spread, money spread
Money spread, money spread, money spread
Money spread, money spread, money spread
I got hunnids and fifties, huh
I got hunnids, fifties
Money spread, huh, huh
Money spread, huh, huh
Money spread
Pinks and blue like bubblegum
Pinks and blue like bubblegum
Pinks and blue like bubblegum
Pink fifties and blue hunnids, yeah, it look like bubblegum
Showed her my money spread, she spread her legs, yeah, I got her sprung
Copped a fuckin' castle, every bedroom the master
Tall model, bitch, to fuck this ho, you gotta use a ladder
Tall model, bitch, to fuck this ho, you gotta use a ladder
It's More Chaos, first it's beautiful, then it's a disaster
This a money spread, hunnids goin' up my leg, yeah-yeah
She wanna ride it, huh, she wanna ride, I told her get on the pegs
I'm all inside of her, huh, could've been a gynecologist
Broke as fuck, yeah, I know you ain't got no money spread
Huh, money spread, money spread, money spread
Money spread, money spread, money spread
Money spread, money spread, money spread
I got hunnids and fifties, huh
I got hunnids, fifties
Money spread, huh, huh
Money spread, huh, huh
Money spread
Song over
